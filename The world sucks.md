The Story of a Massacre in Norway — and its Aftermath  
The film is good, but in front of terrorists` attack, the forgiveness is just be used, the proud of normal people account nothing, they are just number in counting the damage, the survivors are just the result of calculation probability. When Viljar said, he decided to live because he has family, dream, friends etc, and the criminal has nothing, but this is ridiculous, before the terror attack happens, those terrorists planned and thought of everything. Loneliness is not what they care about, the end of the story is so weak and pale, but what they could say, they couldn't say let's change the way and close the door to the refugee. They are now allowed to.

Then how about Chinese persons, they are fucked by the biggist terrorists group, the communist party for nearly 70 years, who cares about? Further more, Chinese people actually are fucked by the cruel for thousands of years, and no one could change, the result is Chinese people learned to love the violence， which is called stockholm symdrom.  
The world is becoming worse and worse, democratic, ustice, humanity, just like placebo, and sometime they're excuse for those US policticians to start new war.    
The world sucks.
